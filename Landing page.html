        <h2>Choose your own adventure:</h2>
        <p> While maintaining focus is important, sometimes a single call to action doesn’t quite capture the types of visitors your landing page receives. In these cases, it can be quite effective to provide multiple options. For buyers who want to craft something personal, the first call to action invites you to create your own bouquet. But for those short on time or imagination, “curated selections” provide a shortcut to celebrating an important person or occasion.</p>
        <h2>May Classes:</h2>
        <p>May is the month of enjoyment. Busy taking cares of everyone in our daily life. Pick a day and save an afternoon for ourselves.</p>

        <h1>Brand Opening Ceremony:</h1>
        <p>Balloons and flowers create a cheerful atmosphere for brand opening. The flowers that match the brand's color scheme will make the color of the space more consistent. The party with desserts, balloons, and flowers is the most lively.</p>

        <h1>Wedding Ceremony:</h1>
